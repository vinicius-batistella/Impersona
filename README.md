## Impersona

Impersona is a small personal project whose main goal is to create a portable  way to spawn a cmd shell with another user's session.
Basically, if you have admin privileges on a machine, it's possible to spawn a cmd shell with the session of a given process ID. In other words, impersonating another user.
